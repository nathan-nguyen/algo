This problem can be easily solved by using brute force O (n * m)

However, it also can be solved with complexity O(n * log n)
--> This is a pretty nice solution.

My solution: We can sort both keyboards and drives first, and then using binary search to find the maximum sum.
--> Although complexity is O(n * log n) but this is not a nice solution.
