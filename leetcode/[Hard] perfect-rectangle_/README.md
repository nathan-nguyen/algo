# Perfect Rectangle

Current approach:

Part 1: Total area of all rectanges should be equal to the smallest rectangle that surounds them.

Part 2: Check whether exist 2 rectangles that are overlap.

--> Count the total number of each vertex

The number of each vertex of the smallest rectangle should be odd (equal to 1) (1 - 1 - 1 - 1)
The number of each vertex of component rectangles should be even (2 - 2 - 2 - 2 or 4 - 4 - 4 - 4)
