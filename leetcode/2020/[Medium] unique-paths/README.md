# unique-paths

Mathematic solution:

- In order to reach Finish position, we need to go right m steps and go down n steps. The order of going down and going right would form unique path.

- Let's say we have n + m steps, m step for going rights, and n steps for going down.

- Therefore the number of unique path: (n + m)! / n! / m!
