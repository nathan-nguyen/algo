wiggle-sort-ii_
    nth_element function in C/C++
    Median of Medians
        Quick Select
    Dutch national flag problem
    kth-largest-element-in-an-array - cleetcode - O(n)
        Blum-Floyd-Pratt-Rivest-Tarjan
--> It is not possible to archive O(n) because nth_element worst case is (n log n)
--> kth-largest-element-in-an-array worst cases is O(n log n)
--> However, average case is expected to be O(n)
